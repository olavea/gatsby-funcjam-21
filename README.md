# Ruby's TimeShip

Is a serverless Gatsby function fueled by gold.
Ruby Reckless built her TimeShip in 1554. So she can go to the future and find The Pirate Princess Lilly (11 <span role="img" aria-label="pirate flag">🏴‍☠️</span><span role="img" aria-label="pirate princess">👸</span> ). Lilly will help save Ruby's sister, Princess Lizabeth from prison in the Tower of London back in 1554.
